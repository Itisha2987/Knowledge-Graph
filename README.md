# Knowledge-Graph

In this project we try to build a knowledge graph based on multisensory information. The multisensory inputs include, intrinsic and deliberate emotions, messages across system modules and memory units, and sensorimotor responses to the inputs. Besides the basic modalities of vision, audition, olfaction, touch and taste, the structures cover secondary senses like temperature, kinesthetics, flavour, space and time. The design draws inspiration from functions of human brain components, particularly the angular gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, multisensory neocortex and limbic system, and epigenomes.
